# Slot Machine

## Project Description

The Slot Machine smart contract is a decentralized gambling application built on the Aptos blockchain that implements classic slot machine mechanics with progressive jackpots. Players can spin the slot machine by placing bets in AptosCoin, with the chance to win various prizes based on the combination of three randomly generated numbers (0-9). The contract features a progressive jackpot system where a portion of each bet contributes to a growing jackpot pool, creating excitement and increasing potential rewards over time.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, fair, and entertaining blockchain-based gaming experience that combines the thrill of traditional slot machines with the security and transparency of smart contracts. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that all game outcomes are provably random and that the progressive jackpot system operates with complete transparency, building trust between players and the platform.
